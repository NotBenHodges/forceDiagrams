    <h1>Force Diagrams!</h1>
    <h3>Here are 3 datasets that can be represented by a force diagram.</h3>
    <p>1. <a href="https://bl.ocks.org/micahstubbs/a9eb7847c56c4c844d36cfbc5075be73#groups.json">Data 1</a></p>
    <img src="Data1.png" alt="Dataset1" class="a">
    <p>This dataset represents employees and the organizations they work for.
    A force diagram could useful for this dataset because nodes and edges could
    very well display the connections between workers in organizations.  </p>
    <p>2. <a href="https://gist.github.com/timelyportfolio/5049980/#file-miserables-json">Data 2</a></p>
    <img src="Data2.png" alt="Dataset2" class="b">
    <p>This dataset represents characters from the musical Les Miserables.
    Each character has a name a group assigned to it to organize which characters
    are related to each other. Here the edges on a force-directed graph could be
    useful in determining who is in contact with each other based on the number
    of edges.</p>
    <p>3. <a href="https://medium.com/ninjaconcept/interactive-dynamic-force-directed-graphs-with-d3-da720c6d7811">Data 3</a></p>
    <img src="Data3.png" alt="Dataset3" class="c">
    <p>Here is a dataset that uses species as nodes and animals as subnodes.
    A diagram made from this dataset would be useful in determining what
    animals are in each species.</p>
